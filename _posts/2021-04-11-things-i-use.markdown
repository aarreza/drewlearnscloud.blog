Here's a list of everything I use. 

I have the knack for using Windows at the moment for work but jumping back to Mac is where I most feel at home. 

These are some of the things I am particularly fond of using. I wouldn't list it here if I don't use or like them.

## **Hardware**

At home, I use a dual-booted, partitioned (Windows + Mac) 2 TB [Macbook Pro 15"](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP749?locale=en_CA), [Gears of War Razer Mamba Wireless](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-mamba-wireless/RZ01-02710200-R3M1), and [GameSir GK300 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-gk300-space-gray). I have a secondary main [Macbook Air](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP783?locale=en_CA) paired with a [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2-silver), which I've dedicated for learning and creating this [blog](index.html). 

I have a single [32" Samsung Curved Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/ca/monitors/curved/curved-monitor-32-inch-lc32f391fwnxza/?cid=ca_owned_ppc_google_curved-monitor_sustain_monitors-2020_text_20180107-{keywords}_w) mounted to my desk which comes with a handy _Eye Saver Mode_.

> **New monitors offer viewing experience ideal for gaming and multimedia, while reducing eye strain.**

I have a dual vertical laptop stand from [AboveTEK](https://www.amazon.ca/Vertical-Laptop-Stand-AboveTEK-Computer/dp/B08F742YG1/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=abovetek+vertical+laptop&qid=1618264105&s=office&sr=1-1) and I use the [J5 Create USB-C hub](https://en.j5create.com/products/jca374) to connect my external peripherals. 

My headphones of choice, one that have served me well for nearly 6 years now is the [Audio Technica ATH-M40X](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-m40x) and within the last year my [Gen 2 Airpods](https://www.apple.com/ca/airpods-2nd-generation/) which thankfully held on to my earbuds pretty well. 

I have two mobile phones, for personal I use an [iPhone 7 Plus](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP744?locale=en_CA) and for work, the regular [iPhone 7](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP743?locale=en_CA). I haven't decided yet if I should upgrade to the latest [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/?afid=p238%7Csvecko2PB-dc_mtid_20925xpb40345_pcrid_479829983696_pgrid_110157897054_&cid=wwa-ca-kwgo-iphone-slid--Brand-iPhone-Availibility-). 

Storage wise, I recycled an old [Lenovo Thinkpad T420](https://support.lenovo.com/ca/en/solutions/pd015734-detailed-specifications-thinkpad-t420) with a [1TB WD Blue Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.ca/Blue-NAND-1TB-SSD-WDS100T2B0A/dp/B073SBQMCX) and made it as my NAS storage for media. I still have my rugged and trusty [ADATA HD710](https://www.adata.com/us/consumer/478) external hard drive. 

For printing, I use consumer grade [HP Envy 4520](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-envy-4520-all-in-one-printer-series/5447920).

## **Software**

I mainly use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) for browsing. Sometimes [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), but I rarely use [Safari](https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/) nowadays. I've recently opted to use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for searching the web and it is a better alternative search bar for anonymity. I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note-taking. 

For VPN, I use [TorGuard](https://torguard.net/) for personal and [Cisco AnyConnect](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_ca/products/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/index.html) at work. 

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my default IDE. I've replaced my Terminal with [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with custom Fonts with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). I'll probably do a separate post on how I've configured my dev environment, maybe on Ubuntu this time. 

As for my cloud storage, I use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onedrive/onedrive-for-business), [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/ca/icloud/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2). 

For Windows and work, I mainly use [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products) and collaborate using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). I use [RSAT tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=45520), [VMware Remote Console](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=VMRC1200&productId=974), [Remote Desktop Connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Services), [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/), and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/). 

Occasionally, I check in to my [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) channels. 

## **This web blog**

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The runner-ups were [Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I wanted to get this blog up and running quickly and figured static websites is the way to go. I found [Jekyll markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) was easy to pickup. I used [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for my domain name and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/what-is-cloudflare/?&_bt=501259408302&_bk=&_bm=b&_bn=g&_bg=117126637894&_placement=&_target=&_loc=1002471&_dv=c&awsearchcpc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjnAQzQQ_tIn_HYn9e3D_iNsS22mz0BZgegYWZUqZzTgbJBMibaxHAcaAlxuEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) for [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) service. I currently use [jekyll-dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash) as the theme for this [blog](index.html). 

## **Entertainment**

At some point, I plan on building this [PC](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/469kfP). Looking to spend no more than $2k which gives me a bit of room to play with the parts. I use [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) for specs.

Believe it or not, I game on my Mac dual booted with Windows and it does the job with [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/boot-camp) drivers and [Radeon Pro 450](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-pro-450.c2899). I have 2 wireless [Xbox 360 Controllers](https://www.amazon.ca/Xbox-360-Wireless-Controller/dp/B003ZSP0WW) which I still use for PC gaming with a third-party [Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver](https://www.amazon.ca/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2).

I play [Starcraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/), [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2), [Star Wars Battlefront 2](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2), [Star Wars: Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order), and [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/home). 

I am also a big fan of [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/) and occasionally play [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/), [Death Squared](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/death-squared-switch/), [Overcooked](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/overcooked-all-you-can-eat-switch/), [Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/), and [Ultra Street Fighter 2](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ultra-street-fighter-ii-the-final-challengers-switch/).

As for home media, I use an [Apple TV](https://www.apple.com/ca/tv/), loaded with all the latest Canadian content subscriptions: [Netlix](https://www.netflix.com/ca/), [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/), [Apple TV app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-tv/id1174078549), [Crave](https://www.crave.ca/en/subscribe?cid=ps%3ACraveTV%3Agoogle%3Asearchad%3AAvailableNow%3ABrand&gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUbYZhGEBRaDJ4Hx1DBtRJf8xcYLX5YApo5JAbX4bJRNmiwnIKmz4aAk76EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), and [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/). For apps, I use [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). I also have an [Amazon Echo Plus](https://www.amazon.ca/All-new-Echo-Plus-2nd-built/dp/B0794VRH3Q) as a bluetooth speaker and automation.
